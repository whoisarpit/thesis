  I wish to express my greatest gratitude to my advisor \supervisorname. During the course of this research, he provided patient and detailed guidance, as well as valuable mentorship that has helped me grow as a researcher and a person. His exemplary attitude and diligence always inspired me to work harder and smarter. Under his supervision, I always found the freedom to explore ideas and the confidence and support to pursue them.

  Moreover, I would like to thank all my friends for their company, support, and valuable advice throughout my life. I would also like to thank my lab mates and colleagues at CYSREN for their support and encouragement.

  Last but not least, I would like to express my most sincere and deepest love to my family for their unconditional love and support throughout my life. I would not have been able to achieve this without them.
