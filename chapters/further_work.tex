\section{Conclusion}

In this thesis, the problem of automated teaching workload allocation to faculty members was addressed. The proposed solutions lend well to allocating a well-balanced teaching workload to all faculty members while accounting for faculty preference, performance, and management priorities. The teaching allocation process was split into four sub-problems - determining the workload of each faculty in the domains of research and service to equitably distribute the workload, determining the workload of the teaching activities of the courses, allocating lectures of a course to the faculty, and allocating tutorials and labs of a course to the faculty.

The technique proposed to quantify the research workload of the faculty was based on the management of the research team under the faculty's supervision. There was a non-linear correlation found between the size of the research team and the research workload of the faculty, owing to a naturally hierarchical structure of staff management, with some staff being directly managed by the faculty, who in turn manage the rest of the research staff, especially for larger research teams. This non-linearity was modeled using a hyperbolic tangent function, and the approach was found to be effective in quantifying the research workload of the faculty.

The service workload was measured based on the individual service activities which were manually rated by the management and were added to derive the service workload of the faculty. The workload modeling into the RTS ratio and its subsequent use in allocating teaching workload to faculty was found to be effective in ensuring that the faculty workload was equitably distributed, and the faculty members were not overloaded with work.

Next, the approach for quantifying the teaching activities of a course involved dividing the activity into four distinct constituents, namely - preparation, review, delivery, and grading workload. The workload for each of these constituents was modeled individually for lectures, tutorials, and lab sessions, accounting for the effects of class size and faculty familiarity with the course. This showed that the workload of lectures was anywhere from 150 to 700 units, being highly dependent on the class size and faculty familiarity, while the workload of tutorials and labs was more uniform, at 20-40 units, with little impact from class size and faculty familiarity. A splitting strategy was also introduced to split the workload of a lecture into 2-3 smaller lectures to improve allocations of lectures with notably higher workloads.

An allocation technique, based on the Hungarian Algorithm, was proposed for the automated allocation of lectures to faculty members. It allocated lectures based on faculty preference, student feedback, and the management priority of preferential allocation of earlier-year courses to the best faculty. The preferences of the faculty were honored, with $>$50\% of the faculty teaching lectures of their top 5 preferences. However, only 47\% of the lectures were allocated for the real-life dataset examined, thereby demonstrating the need to devise further techniques for dealing with the unallocated lectures.

It was observed that the management's priority for preferential allocation of the best faculty to earlier-year courses resulted in a shortage of faculty to teach the later-year courses. This was clearly seen with only 11\% of the Year 5 courses being allocated. However, since this priority was non-negotiable, the allocation process was adapted to account for this by pre-emptively allocating latter-year courses with an acute shortage of faculty supply. This made it possible to allocate an additional 16.3\% of the lectures to the faculty with an asymmetrical improvement in latter-year courses, with 89.1\% of the Year 5 courses being allocated.

The other issues were primarily related to demand and supply mismatches, with the availability of faculty and expertise for certain courses being limited. Firstly, the coarse granularity of lectures, which was somewhat resolved by the initial splitting strategy, still resulted in a few unallocated lectures. To overcome this limitation, a dynamic splitting strategy was introduced to involve faculty members with high teaching workloads. This approach made it possible to independently allocate an additional 22.5\% of the lectures to the faculty.

It was found that some lectures couldn't be allocated even with splitting, due to an acute shortage of faculty supply. To alleviate this, targeted overloading of faculty was introduced, with the foresight that the additional workload would be compensated by underloading the faculty in the subsequent allocation of tutorials and labs. This was able to independently allocate an additional 35.8\% of the lectures to the faculty.

Finally, a dynamic swapping strategy was introduced, which retrospectively identified the lectures that couldn't be allocated due to prioritization of earlier-year courses and attempted to free up faculty members for teaching these lectures, by swapping their lectures with other faculty while ensuring that the teaching performance was not compromised. This was able to independently allocate an additional 15.6\% of the lectures to the faculty. When combined, these techniques were able to allocate 97.5\% of the lectures to the faculty members. Finally, a pre-emptive overloading of all the faculty members was introduced if the aforementioned techniques were unable to allocate all the lectures to the faculty. This was able to allocate 99.4\% of the lectures to the faculty members. An allocation of all the lectures would be achieved if the workload limits were relaxed for the remaining 0.6\% of the lectures.

To allocate tutorials and labs to faculty members, the proposed techniques based on the Hungarian Algorithm were adapted to account for additional challenges unique to tutorials and lab sessions. It was found that a problem of fragmentation exists, with the tutorials of many courses being allocated to each faculty, which would result in additional overhead. To address this, a consistency bias was introduced to favor the faculty members who were already teaching other parts of the same course in some fashion. This was found to be effective, reducing the number of faculty teaching the tutorials and labs of the same course from 4.6 faculty teaching tutorials and labs of a course to 3.8 faculty. However, it was noticed that modifying the cost of allocation to bias the Hungarian Algorithm towards a certain allocation led to marginal improvement, and a more fundamental change in the approach was needed for further improvements.

To address this, a batching technique was introduced, which allocated tutorials and labs in batches of multiple sessions at a time, reducing fragmentation. It was evident that the batch size must be adapted specifically for other datasets. The batching was able to further reduce the number of faculty teaching the tutorials and labs of the same course to 1.9 faculty, which was a significant improvement over the original 4.6 faculty. It is also important to note that both techniques were able to achieve this improvement without adversely affecting workload equity and quality of allocation.

Certain unallocated tutorials and labs remained, which were again found to be due to supply-demand asymmetries. The pre-emptive allocation of tutorials was introduced, which was able to reduce the number of unallocated tutorials by 3\%. Additionally, a selective workload relaxation technique was introduced, which identified and iteratively relaxed the workload limits causing the unallocated tutorials and labs to allow their allocation. This reduced the number of unallocated tutorials and labs from 27\% to 0\% without adversely affecting the workload equity. The tutorial and lab allocation process, in combination with these techniques, was able to allocate 100\% of the tutorials and labs to the faculty members in an automated manner, at the expense of overloading 9.6\% of the faculty members, of which only 1.8\% were heavily overloaded.

Unlike existing heuristic-based approaches, the proposed techniques were also found to be highly deterministic and scalable. The batching of tutorials further helped achieve this scalability, due to the reduction in matrix sizes and iterations for the Hungarian Algorithm. The entire allocation process allocated the activities of an entire semester involving 1152 lectures, tutorials, and labs, within 30 seconds on a standard PC, and was also able to adapt to the various challenges that may be posed by a variety of datasets.

\section{Future Work}

The allocation of teaching workload to faculty is a complex problem, and while the allocation achieved in this thesis is fair and equitable, there are still certain areas of improvement that can be made. Some of these areas are discussed below.

\subsection{Inter-semester workload balancing}

It is often inevitable to overload certain faculty members in a semester to ensure all courses can be supported. It would be interesting to explore if a faculty could be overloaded in one semester and compensated for by an inter-semester workload balancing process. It is envisaged that balancing the workload in one academic year as opposed to at the semester level will provide additional flexibility.

\subsection{Workforce Gap Analysis}

Techniques like pre-allocation highlighted the shortage of eligible faculty for certain courses. In addition, examining faculty members who have been assigned with least preferred courses can reveal an acute shortage of faculty expertise in certain areas. Such observations can be relied upon as the basis to facilitate a workforce gap analysis, which can be used to determine the number of additional faculty that need to be hired to ensure that all courses can be taught by eligible faculty. A closer examination of the degree of deviation from faculty preference should pave the way for identifying a shortage of expertise in certain areas. This, in combination with the need for systematic overloading of faculty, shows the possibility for a more targeted hiring process, which can result in enhanced user satisfaction and overall productivity of faculty members.

\subsection{Realization of Institutional Goals}

The RTS model provided a transparent and insightful metric for the workload of the faculty. RTS for the entire faculty cohort can be used to evaluate the overall standing of a department for fulfilling the research-intensive mandate at the institutional level. For example, a research-intensive university may aim for an aggregate RTS Ratio of $R:T:S = 6:4:2$. The RTS ratio at the faculty level can be scrutinized to mentor faculty who could benefit from re-balancing his/her workload in research, teaching, and service.

\subsection{Accounting for the impact of Teaching Assistants}

Teaching Assistants (TAs) are typically graduate students who assist the faculty in teaching the course. Their role is to assist the faculty in teaching activities, such as grading, and ease the delivery of the tutorials and labs. Their presence might help in reducing the overall teaching workload of a faculty while improving the learning outcomes of the students taught. The impact of TAs on the teaching workload of the faculty is not accounted and thus, adapting the proposed models for incorporating TA support would be a worthy pursuit.

\subsection{Dynamic Batching of Tutorials and Labs}

With the static batching of tutorials and labs, the batch size needed to be tweaked to achieve a balance of granularity and fragmentation, based on the dataset. It would be interesting to explore if the batching decisions can be made at the course level. This could pave the way for an effective approach to minimize fragmentation, which in turn could reduce the dependency on manual intervention. Thus, a dynamic batching strategy at the course level would be a worthy pursuit.

\subsection{Timetabling Constraints}

Timetabling of the courses is carried out separately, independent of the allocation of teaching workload to faculty. However, the two processes should be made interdependent to minimize conflicts during the timetabling phase. It would therefore be interesting to examine ways to incorporate the timetabling constraints into the teaching allocation process to ensure that the courses are timetabled in a way that allows the courses to be taught by the same faculty. Other timetabling constraints such as the distance between classrooms can also be incorporated into the allocation process to ensure that faculty will have adequate time to reach the next class.
